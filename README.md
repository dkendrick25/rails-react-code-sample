# Code Sample

My name is DeeAnn Kendrick and I have been working with Ruby on Rails and React
for a little over a year now. I worked at an Atlanta Startup, which utilized those
technologies.

This repository contains code excerpts from that application.

1. Announcement Automation - An example of one of three automated announcements
I wrote to help our clients with announcement content creation.

2. Background Job - An example of a background job I wrote to help offload the 
time spent on large csv uploads freeing up our admin's time to continue working.

3. Flag Questions - Our application contained a quiz game written in React. This
sample includes a snippet of a feature I built that allowed users to alert us when
a question was factually incorrect or had a grammatical error.
